# IC Eliza ETH Wallet Demo 

AI Agents hold a lot of promise when it comes to automating tasks in crypto. But there are some challenges with them: 
1. Most AI Agents run in a web2 environment: which requires you to give your private keys, thus bringing some security concerns. 
2. Unless you've built some server to access the agent, you have to manually access some server just to control the agent 

The IC Eliza ETH Wallet Demo [Kristofer Lund](https://github.com/kristoferlund) is a starter template for developing your own crypto AI Agent. It includes a demo plugin for the Eliza Agent Framework, allowing a conversational AI Agent to interact with an Ethereum Deployed wallet on ICP.

## Why Deploy an Ethereum Wallet on the IC?
- **Use of Threshold Signatures**: Allows transactions to be signed without exposing private keys. Threshold signature is a feature on ICP that allows multiple parties to sign a transaction without exposing the private keys.
- **Always Online Wallet**: The wallet can self-host its own UI.

The Wallet UI is a simple application that allows users to view the wallet's balance, address, and ICP Identity. It also allows setting security rules for the agent.

## Getting Started

There are two repositories for this demo: 
1. [ic-eliza-eth-wallet](https://github.com/kristoferlund/ic-eliza-eth-wallet) - the Ethereum Wallet Deployed on ICP 
2. [ic-eliza-eth-wallet-plugin](https://github.com/kristoferlund/ic-eliza-eth-wallet-agent) - the Eliza plugin enabling the AI Agent to interact with the Ethereum wallet 

We'll first start by cloning and running the Ethereum Wallet, then proceed to running the AI Agent that interacts with the Ethereum Wallet.

### Deploy the Ethereum Wallet

1. **Clone the Repo**: 
    ```bash 
    git clone https://github.com/kristoferlund/ic-eliza-eth-wallet.git
    ``` 

    This is the file structure of the project: 
    ```bash 
    src
       |_backend # the evm wallet that creates the transactions and stores the data 
       |_evm_rpc # responsible for running requests from ICP to the EVM RPC provider outside ICP
       |_frontend # hosts the wallet UI 
       |_internet_identity # responsible for handling authentication 
    ``` 

2. **Setup the Pre-requisites**: 
    An [Etherscan API key](https://etherscan.io/apis) is required to query the wallet ETH balance. Creating an Etherscan account is free.

    Save the API key to a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project:
    ```bash
    echo "VITE_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY" > .env.local
    ``` 

3. **Deploying the Project**: 
    ```bash 
    npm install # install all the dependencies first

    dfx start --clean --background  # start the local dfx replica

    # Pull and deploy the evm_rpc canister locally 
    dfx deps pull 

    dfx deps init evm_rpc --argument '(record {})' 

    dfx deps deploy

    dfx deploy # deploy all the canisters
    ```

    Once that is complete, you can check the UI in the frontend URL canister.

### Understanding and Deploying the Eliza ETH Wallet Agent

The next step is to understand and deploy the Eliza ETH Wallet Agent.

1. **Clone the Repo**: 
    ```bash 
    git clone https://github.com/kristoferlund/ic-eliza-eth-wallet-agent.git 

    cd ic-eliza-eth-wallet-agent 
    ``` 

2. **Understanding the File Structure**: 
    ```bash
    |_src
         ... 
         |_plugins
             |_ic-eth-wallet # contains the actions for the agent
                   |_ getAddress.ts # gets the ethereum address of the agent 
                   |_ getBalance.ts # gets the ethereum balance of the agent
                   |_ getIdentity.ts # getting the IC identity
                   |_ sendEth.ts # sending ETH 
             |_canisters
             |_providers
                   |_wallet 
                       |_ index.ts # responsible for managing internet identity and managing the communication with the deployed wallet
                   |_ index.ts # contains the icETHWallet plugin 
    ```

    The `sendETH` action is the most complicated one. It does the following: 
    - Creates an instance of the wallet provider that enables communication with IC 
    - Parses the message from the user to a structured data that we can pass to the wallet
    - Uses the `composeContext` and generate object functions of the eliza framework to properly structure the request 
       - It has some parameters: `sendEthTemplate`: transforms the prompt given by the user to a structured data needed to interact with the wallet canister 

3. **Adding Environment Variables**: 
    We'll create a `.env` file and add the environment variables there.

    ```bash 
    touch .env 

    # create the identity for the agent
    dfx identity new ai_agent_identity --storage-mode=plaintext

    # export the private key
    dfx identity export ai_agent_identity

    # Save the private key in a file 
    dfx identity export ai_agent_identity > ai_agent_identity.pem 

    # Extract the raw private key from the PEM file using OpenSSL 
    dfx identity export ai_agent_identity | openssl ec -text -noout | grep -A 3 priv: | tail -n +2 | tr -d '[:space:]:' | tr -d '\n'
    ```

    Copy the generated private key and paste it in the `INTERNET_COMPUTER_PRIVATE_KEY` field in the `.env` file.

    Then take the `backend` URL from the deployed wallet and paste it in the `IC_ETH_WALLET_CANISTER` field in the `.env` file.

4. **Starting the Agent**: 
    ```bash 
    # install the dependencies 
    pnpm install 

    # start the agent
    bash scripts/start.sh
    ```

    Once it runs successfully, this is what you'll see in your terminal: 
    ```bash
    You: [2025-03-17 11:51:36] INFO: Maxwell Sterling III(214b8a0a-364e-047b-ab99-31060e6a222c) - Setting Model Provider:
        characterModelProvider: "openai"
        optsModelProvider: "openai"
        finalSelection: "openai"
    [2025-03-17 11:51:36] INFO: Maxwell Sterling III(214b8a0a-364e-047b-ab99-31060e6a222c) - Selected model provider: openai
    [2025-03-17 11:51:36] INFO: Maxwell Sterling III(214b8a0a-364e-047b-ab99-31060e6a222c) - Selected image model provider: openai
    [2025-03-17 11:51:36] INFO: Maxwell Sterling III(214b8a0a-364e-047b-ab99-31060e6a222c) - Selected image vision model provider: openai
    [2025-03-17 11:51:36] INFO: Initializing LlamaService...
    ```

    Now you can press `enter` and start interacting with the agent.

### Interacting with the Agent

You can try out the following prompts: 
- What is my Ethereum address?
- What is my internet identity?
- Send some ETH, like 0.0001 ETH to 0xF6B34a431A5FDA268003D3a5613EA4B758d29794

**Before Sending Some ETH**: 
- You need to add some ETH to the wallet.
- You also need to set the agent rules.
